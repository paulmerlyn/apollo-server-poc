To get the full functionality of this project, you'll need to run the mock REST endpoint server. Do that by navigating in my Darter Pro to: 

~/code/learning/graphQL/speakers/bin

(which I downloaded as the speakers project in Resources relating to Chapter 4 of Jonathan Mills's Building a GraphQL API with Apollo Server Pluralsight course). To get the API executing, type this:

$ node www

The main project (i.e. the source code that I've written by following Jonathan's course) is, of course, in ~/code/learning/graphQL/graphQLApi/.

To run that project, easiest to invoke it from VS Code's Run/(Re)Start Debugging
